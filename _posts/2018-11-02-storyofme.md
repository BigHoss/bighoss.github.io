Story of me and how i got here
Hey, nice of you to check me out.
I am Raphael, i work as a software engineer (C#) and i do, and did, a lot of other stuff.

![Me]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blue_portrait.jpeg)

My career started off as an IT supporter, or more that i had an apprenticeship to become one. At the company i worked on i learned a lot of things, but not really in the realm of IT. I learned a lot about electricity, antenna (satellite an terrestrial) installations and sales. But i was not really pleased by that so i changed companies after 3 years to finish what i started at a company with more IT focus.
Then i had to go to the Austrian Armed Forces to do my national service for 6 month. During that time i was working as a combat-writer, s i did the most work on a pc. And started to improve the software the battalion was using. These were my first real steps into software development.
With a short break after that i started working in a software company in the support and service department. We had to take care of installations and maintenance, so finding and documenting bugs. At that time i knew i wanted to become a software engineer.
Parallel to that i did a lot of event work, starting with visuals, djing, light designs and complete organisational stuff.

After 3 years at the support department the event business was taking too much time so i decided to leave the it behind and work at it full time.
Almost a full year later and after several learned lessons i knew that the event business was not what i want myself to get old with. So i closed my company and started looking for a new job. That i found in a software company providing business solutions(ERP for SME and clubs) done with filemaker. I made a few interfaces to other softwares using C# and a lot of copy/pasting and trying to get an idea how everything works.
At that time i saw that i need more theory to really succeed in that industry. So i started a c# software developer training at our local economics training institute. The company paid for that training, the day after the CTO of that company told us that he will leave us a few of us were let go. I finished that training and started looking for a new company afterwards.

After a festival summer(working there of course) the new company found me. It was an industrial company with an internal application development team, that i joined. Because of limitations from the holding that company was not allowed to directly employ new people so i was hired as a temporary(leasing) working via an external company. After a few months passed were i didn't get the promised offer to get hired directly i was let go by the company.
I am living next to a country where the pay grade is a lot higher than at home so i tried that next. So i started working at a company with a 75km way to work, each week, i spent a whole workday, just driving. At first it didn't bother me but the longer it was, the more it stressed me out.
A few weeks ago i started working back "at home" again. We'll see how that turns out.
So there is a lot more going on in my life. I try to write regular stories to get that stuff out of my head.
All of the stories i write are my personal opinions. I know they are quite different and they can change. Please criticise me, i like it a lot, and maybe you can help me to get better at whatever it is.
